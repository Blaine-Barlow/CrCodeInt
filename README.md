Personal Cracking the Code Interview Problem

This is a practice project that involves attempting to solve the practice problems in the Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions
and Solutions. By Gayle Laakmann McDowell. 6th Edition. 

I will attempt each problem myself before looking at the solutions. 

With an idea of staying sharp on different languages, I may be using a docker-compose file to work with different languages (C#, Java, and Python).
I will try to switch languages each problem so as to keep things interesting the basics and problem solving will remain the same.
